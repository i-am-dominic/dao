# DAO Smart Contract

This is a simple DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) smart contract implemented in Solidity.

## Description

The DAO smart contract allows for the creation of proposals and voting by members. Each member is allocated tokens that they can use to vote on proposals. If a proposal receives enough votes, it can be executed, allowing for decentralized decision-making within the organization.

## Features

- Add and remove members dynamically
- Create proposals with descriptions
- Vote on proposals using allocated tokens
- Execute proposals if they receive enough votes

## Usage

1. Deploy the smart contract to a compatible blockchain network (e.g., Ethereum)
2. Add members to the DAO using the `addMember` function
3. Create proposals using the `createProposal` function, providing a description
4. Members can vote on proposals using the `vote` function, specifying the proposal ID and the amount of tokens they want to use for voting
5. If a proposal receives enough votes, it can be executed using the `executeProposal` function
